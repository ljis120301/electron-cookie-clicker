## Cookie Clicker build with Electron, Next JS, and Tailwind CSS

This is clone of the popular cookie clicker game, this is a proof of concept for me to learn how to convert a already exsting Next JS project of mine into a Electron Desktop application to better understand Electron and how to put JavaScript into the desktop expirence. This repo serves as an educational example of how to use Electron, Next JS, and Tailwind CSS all within the same project and have them bundled together nicley. 

### Getting Started
